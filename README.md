# BG Social - LHL Final Project


## About BG Social

- BG Social offers a Facebook like social platform for board game enthusiasts. It allows users to invite their friends (in-app) to participate in board game events and track participants' scores for each game. Moreover, it aims to solve the issue of coordination by introducing features such as **voting** and **open event**. The app encourages friendly competition by offering game / score related statistics with which users can compare with his / her friends.
